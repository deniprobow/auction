  src/
    components/
    pages/
    redux/
    routes/
    services/
    App.css
    App.tsx
    App.test.js
    index.css

For the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:

public/index.html is the page template;
src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.
You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside src. For faster rebuilds, only files inside src are processed by Webpack.
You need to put any JS and CSS files inside src, otherwise Webpack wonâ€™t see them.

Only files inside public can be used from public/index.html.
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

# Technology Used
- ReactJs Typescript for Frontend Scripting
- ReactBootstrap for themed and styling
- NestJs for rest-api backend scripting
- Mysql Maria Db for database

# Sample Account
You can use this account for sample, or you can create new account with register feature.
    username    : **joe@email.com**
    password    : **12345**

# Deployment
npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js file.
